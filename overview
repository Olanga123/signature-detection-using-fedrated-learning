📌 Project Overview

This project is part of a larger research-oriented system aimed at Signature Detection using Federated Learning.
The current implementation serves as a baseline machine learning prototype to study classification behavior, decision boundaries, and phase-transition–like phenomena using logistic regression on synthetic data.

The long-term goal is to:

Replace synthetic data with real signature images

Move from centralized training to Federated Learning (FL)

Ensure data privacy across distributed clients (banks, institutions, devices)

🧠 Motivation

Signature verification systems face two major challenges:

Privacy – signature data is highly sensitive

Generalization – signatures vary across users, time, and conditions

Federated Learning allows training a global model without sharing raw data, making it ideal for signature detection systems deployed across multiple organizations.

This repository currently focuses on:

Understanding binary classification behavior

Analyzing learning dynamics

Preparing the ML pipeline for federated extension

🛠️ Current Implementation Summary
🔹 Data Generation

Synthetic 2D Ising-model–like lattice data is generated

Each sample represents a binary state matrix

Labels are assigned based on a critical threshold (analogous to phase transition)

This mimics how handwritten signatures can transition between genuine and forged patterns.

🔹 Model Architecture

Logistic Regression implemented using PyTorch

Single linear layer + sigmoid activation

Binary classification using Binary Cross Entropy Loss

🔹 Training Strategy

Mini-batch gradient descent

Adam optimizer

Train-test split (80/20)

Performance tracked via:

Loss per epoch

Classification accuracy

🔹 Visualization & Analysis

The code produces:

Accuracy vs Epoch Plot – learning behavior

Phase Classification vs Temperature Plot – decision boundary analysis

Ordered vs Disordered State Visualization – pattern separation

These visualizations help interpret model confidence and transitions, which is crucial for biometric verification tasks.

📊 Results

The model successfully learns a non-random decision boundary

Accuracy improves steadily across epochs

Clear separation between two phases (classes)

This validates the classification pipeline before scaling to federated learning.
